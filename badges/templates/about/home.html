            <h3>
                How it Works.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Everyone is an Expert in something. Maybe you know how to make
                <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/isaachsieh/2948306815/" target="_blank">
                the perfect costume for your pet</a>. Or you bring objects to life
                <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:64004" target="_blank">
                via 3D-drafting and printing</a>.
                The point is that we're a curious crew that's down to learn how to make the next thing--
                whether it be digital, analog or abstract. Sound about right?
            </p>
            <p>At P2PU, Badges are a way to recognize and support that expertise as it evolves.
                If you see a Badge on <a href="http://badges.p2pu.org" target="_blank">badges.p2pu.org</a>
                that's in line with a Project you're working on,
                you can submit it for feedback from an Expert.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img height="545" width="609" src="http://info.p2pu.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Badge11.png" class="">
                <br>
            </div>
            <p>When you submit your Project, we'll ask you to step out what you did,
                and reflect a bit on what you'd do differently.
                This might seem obvious to you as the creator of your masterpiece,
                but it'll help you get more targeted feedback (we promise).
            </p>
            <div>
                <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2616" alt="Badge2" src="http://info.p2pu.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Badge2.png" width="609" height="572">
                <br>
            </div>
            <p>
                We'll notify an Expert that your Project is ready.
                An Expert is someone who either
                <ul>
                    <li>made the darn Badge in the first place, or</li>
                    <li>submitted a Project which demonstrated their own wizardry</li>
                </ul>
                They'll come to your Project in short order, and deliver some robust suggestions for your individual needs.
                You'll see that the feedback comes as Kudos, Questions and Concerns:
            </p>
            <div>
                <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2618" alt="Badge3" src="http://info.p2pu.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Badge3.png" width="634" height="483">
                <br>
            </div>
            <p>From here you'll either be awarded the Badge, or prompted to take a look at the feedback
                and improve your project. You can resubmit your Project as many times as you like--all
                the feedback and versions will travel with the original--and we'll try to get the same
                Expert to continue to help you out.
            </p>
            <p>If and when you do acquire the Badge, it will appear on your
                <a href="http://Badges.p2pu.org" target="_blank">Badges.p2pu.org</a>
                profile page, and you'll be an Expert yourself.&nbsp;

                <h3>Creating a Badge.</h3>
                If feedback is a conversation, then creating a Badge sparks a whole community around something you love.
                If you are a P2PU course facilitator, an organizer of a conference, or if a certain subject matter
                floats your boat, consider making a Badge for it:
            </p>

            <div>
                <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2619" alt="Badge4" src="http://info.p2pu.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Badge4.png" width="559" height="482">
                <br>
            </div>
            <p>
                From there, you’ll have a chance to preview and publish your Badge.
                If you just want to save it and come back later, the Badge will appear in your profile
                under “Badges in the Garden Shed.”
            </p>
            <div id="faqs">
                <h3>FAQs.</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>How long will my Badge take to be published and ready for action?</b><br>
                    Immediately. You’ll get to preview it before you publish, and then you’ll get
                    a confirmation that the Badge is live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How do I add a Badge to my P2PU course?</b><br>
                    We’re working on a very light Badges/P2PU course integration in the next 4 weeks.
                    In the meantime, each Badge has a unique URL. Create a new content module
                    (i.e. “Submit Project for a Badge”) and copy and paste the Badge URL into that content field.<br>
                    Here’s an example:
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2630" alt="6EnterP2PUBadge" src="http://info.p2pu.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/6EnterP2PUBadge.png" width="671" height="342">
                    <br>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <b>I'm not in a P2PU course, but I have an event or a project I'd like to create a badge for. Can I?</b><br>
                    Yeah buddy--go for it. You can create a Badge for any kind of Project or event. Just direct folks towards your Badge's particular URL so they can apply for it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>I'm an Expert and Possess the Badge. How Will I Know When Projects Are Submitted?</b><br>
                    We'll notify you with a snappy message in your Inbox.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Do Your Badges Integrate with the Open Badges Infrastructure?</b><br>
                    They will by May 1, 2013. Stay tuned for updates.
